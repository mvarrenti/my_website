        <p><b><i>Predicting the Most Popular Movie of 2025 | Python Boston, MA, Spring 2024</i></b></p>
        <p>• Below you will see a downloadable pdf of a research project that I completed in the spring of 2024 for my Foundations of Data Science (python) class. This project was a two month long effort that was worked on with Benjamin Weiss, Sheena Kaw, and myself. This project was then presented in class to my peers discussing which attributes contribute most to creating the most popular movie of 2024. From the attributes that were found from our data scraping, we were able to curate what would make a movie in 2024 most popular based on season, length of movie, and actors</p>
