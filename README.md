# my_website
I have made this website as a personal project to add to my LinkedIn and for my own development! 
In order to create this site I have used three HTML's and a CSS.
If you wanted to use these outlines, you could download the CSS file and use it as a style guide, and download the HTML's and edit them so that they are geared to what you would like your website to look like. For this, I used VisualStudio Code.
